Sorry for that. It's [an TheJucieMedia reference](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=the%20juice%20media) regarding what's the Australia's Bull$#!t Headquarters ever cooking long before the lockdowns.[^1]

Also because we're f\*\#ked[^2] by the oil and gas $\#\!tlords like Shell and Chervon and even the American and Chinese governments, feel free to send thoughts and prayers while the planet is still on f#@king fire on that address. They'll read it once we're all dead.[^4]

## How do we (not) get f**k'n used to it? [^3]

This list doesn't contains exhaustive list of stuff $#!tlords ever want its own citizens to get f#@K'n used to it regarding gas-lead $\#\!tf\#\*kery.

* Go to Hawaii and send *thoughts and prayers* from there.[^3]
* Don't act against the oil and gas industry and just rely on adaption and reslience.
