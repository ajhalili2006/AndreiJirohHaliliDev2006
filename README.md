### Screen Time as an Dev

I'm usually do coding whenever my other self (aka my mind) wants to, or if during the school year, probably on my free time. May not up-to-date as
Gitpod and GitHub Codespaces don't preserve `/home` directories on workspace restarts. Wakatime stats include my coding activity data since April 13, 2021.
