# Hello, world! üëã

> **INACTIVITY NOTICE**: Since September 23 PHT, I usually inactive due to schoolwork, so PR reviews, replies to mentions and even general support might be delayed. Sorry for that! If you have very-important stuff to say, please reach to me privately through Telegram or Discord, since I'll keep my Facebook Messenger stuff for school and family stuff only.
