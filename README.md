# Hello, world! üëã

> ~~**INACTIVITY NOTICE**: Since September 23 PHT, I usually inactive due to schoolwork, so PR reviews, replies to mentions and even general support might be delayed. Sorry for that! If you have very-important stuff to say, please reach to me privately through Telegram or Discord, since I'll keep my Facebook Messenger stuff for school and family stuff only.~~ Not necessarily inactive since I also do developer stuff more that school, so please send thoughts and prayers to my grades at <shitfuckery@bullshit.hq>.[^1]

I'm Andrei Jiroh, I'm an Filipino 15-year old junior high school student who do Node.js and Python programming stuff and mess up Linux system
administration stuff. Sometimes, I'm also an casual opensource contributor, but most of the the time I work on my own projects alone.
