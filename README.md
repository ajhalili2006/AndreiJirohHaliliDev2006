## My Projects

### Stuff I'm working on

* [Recap Time Squad](https://gitlab.com/RecapTime), (formerly known as The Pins Team) [especially the  Community Radar newsletter](https://gitlab.com/RecapTime/community-radar) - where I mostly do my open-source work there. Here's the tidbits:
  * [Code Server Boilerplates](https://github.com/code-server-boilerplates) - Project Maintainer, collection of ready to made templates for shipping cloud dev environments with code-server pre-installed
  * [Community Lores](https://community-lores.gq) - Maintainer, usually for placing docs stuff in one domain (we do redirection stuff behind the the scenes)
  * [Gitpodified Workspace Images](https://github.com/gitpodify/gitpodified-workspace-images) - an fork of [upstream's workspace images](https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images), implementing fixes and even add some packages.
* [Vaultwarden on PaaS services](https://github.com/RecapTime/vaultwarden-on-paas) - Hard-fork of [bitwardenrs-heroku](https://github.com/std2main/bitwardenrs_heroku) with scripts for automating deployment within minutes, among other features. (now maintained as part of Recap Time Squad's open-source projects)
* GitHub CLI package maintainer for Alpine Linux - version bumps lands on `edge` first, although delays may happen.

### Abandoned Projects

Yeah, press F as many time as you want, and please send thoughts and prayers to these projects to Bull$#!t HQ at <shitfuckery@bullshit.hq>.[^1]

* [Intellivoid SpamProtection API Wrapper for JavaScript](https://github.com/MadeByThePinsHub/Intellivoid-SPB-JS-Wrapper) - due to doing other stuff
* TODO list more abandoned projects here

### Screen Time as an Dev

I'm usually do coding whenever my other self (aka my mind) wants to, or if during the school year, probably on my free time. May not up-to-date as
Gitpod and GitHub Codespaces don't preserve `/home` directories on workspace restarts. Wakatime stats include my coding activity data since April 13, 2021.
